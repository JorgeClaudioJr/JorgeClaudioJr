Hello, world! ... (Yeah, I know.) 

The name is Jorge, I'm from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, I'm 28 years old (while writing this and... thinking how old I already am, but ok) and father of Zelda (Yeah, the Legend). 

Got a crush for coffee, music, anime, dogs and PlayStation. 


Well... I hope we can know each other and fell free to send me a message.
